# Quiz 2

## Lecture 5
- Differentiate between continuous and discrete random variables.
- Calculate and interpret probabilistic quantities (mean, quantiles, prediction intervals, etc) for a continuous random variable
- Match a distribution to sampled data

## Lecture 6
- Explain whether a function is a valid pdf, cdf, qf, sf.
- Calculate mean and quantiles from a cdf, survival function, or quantile function.
- Use the R functions for distribution families to compute distributional quantities or generate a random sample.
- Specifically the functions of the form <x><dist>, such as rnorm() or qunif().
- Identify what makes a function a bivariate density/pdf.
- Compute conditional distributions when events have zero probability.

## Lecture 7
- Interpret a contour plot, especially as a bivariate density.
- Identify the relationship between two independent continuous random variables and their conditional distributions (given one of the two variables).
- Extract the information that a random variable X holds about Y by conditioning on X and producing model functions.
- Compute marginal distributions and means using joint distributions, and especially using conditional distributions.
- Identify the direction of dependence from a contour plot of a joint density function.

## Lecture 8
- Identify the parameterization of the multivariate Gaussian/Normal family.
- Describe the joint density of a bivariate Gaussian distribution in terms of its contours.
- Identify whether a bivariate Gaussian distribution has dependence or independence.
- Compute marginal and conditional distributions from a bivariate Gaussian distribution, and compute the distribution of a linear combination of jointly Gaussian random variables.
- Calculate the density or cdf of a mixture distribution, given the class probabilities and class distributions.
